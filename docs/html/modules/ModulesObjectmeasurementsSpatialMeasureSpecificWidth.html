<h1>Measure specific width</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
Measures the width of the object along the axis passing through two specified reference points.  Reference points can be the object centroid, an image measurement or a measurement associated with the object.  Widths are determined as the distance between the two points along the reference line with the greatest separation (i.e. it doesn't matter if there are gaps between them).
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<ul><li><b>Input objects</b> (default = "") Objects for which specific widths will be calculated.  Width measurements will be associated with these objects.</li><br><li><b>Reference mode 1</b> (default = "Object centroid") The source of the first reference point coordinates:<br><ul><li>"Object centroid" Reference point will be positioned coincident with the centroid of the object being measured.</li><li>"Image measurement" X, Y and Z location of the reference point will be equal to specified measurement values associated with the image (set by "Reference image 1").</li><li>"Object measurement" X, Y and Z location of the reference point will be equal to the specified measurememnt values associated with the object being measured.</li></ul></li><br><li><b>Reference image 1</b> (default = "") If "Reference mode 1" is set to "Image measurement", this is the image that will provide the measurements determining the X, Y and Z location of the first reference point.</li><br><li><b>X-pos. image meas. 1 (px)</b> (default = "") If "Reference mode 1" is set to "Image measurement", this is the measurement, associated with the image specified by "Reference image 1", that will be used as the X-axis location of the first reference point.</li><br><li><b>Y-pos. image meas. 1 (px)</b> (default = "") If "Reference mode 1" is set to "Image measurement", this is the measurement, associated with the image specified by "Reference image 1", that will be used as the Y-axis location of the first reference point.</li><br><li><b>Z-pos. image meas. 1 (slice)</b> (default = "") If "Reference mode 1" is set to "Image measurement", this is the measurement, associated with the image specified by "Reference image 1", that will be used as the Z-axis location of the first reference point.</li><br><li><b>X-pos. object meas. 1 (px)</b> (default = "") If "Reference mode 1" is set to "Object measurement", this is the measurement, associated with the current object, that will be used as the X-axis location of the first reference point.</li><br><li><b>Y-pos. object meas. 1 (px)</b> (default = "") If "Reference mode 1" is set to "Object measurement", this is the measurement, associated with the current object, that will be used as the Y-axis location of the first reference point.</li><br><li><b>Z-pos. object meas. 1 (slice)</b> (default = "") If "Reference mode 1" is set to "Object measurement", this is the measurement, associated with the current object, that will be used as the Z-axis location of the first reference point.</li><br><li><b>Reference mode 2</b> (default = "Object centroid") The source of the second reference point coordinates:<br><ul><li>"Object centroid" Reference point will be positioned coincident with the centroid of the object being measured.</li><li>"Image measurement" X, Y and Z location of the reference point will be equal to specified measurement values associated with the image (set by "Reference image 1").</li><li>"Object measurement" X, Y and Z location of the reference point will be equal to the specified measurememnt values associated with the object being measured.</li></ul></li><br><li><b>Reference image 2</b> (default = "") If "Reference mode 2" is set to "Image measurement", this is the image that will provide the measurements determining the X, Y and Z location of the second reference point.</li><br><li><b>X-pos. image meas. 2 (px)</b> (default = "") If "Reference mode 2" is set to "Image measurement", this is the measurement, associated with the image specified by "Reference image 2", that will be used as the X-axis location of the second reference point.</li><br><li><b>Y-pos. image meas. 2 (px)</b> (default = "") If "Reference mode 2" is set to "Image measurement", this is the measurement, associated with the image specified by "Reference image 2", that will be used as the Y-axis location of the second reference point.</li><br><li><b>Z-pos. image meas. 2 (slice)</b> (default = "") If "Reference mode 2" is set to "Image measurement", this is the measurement, associated with the image specified by "Reference image 2", that will be used as the Z-axis location of the second reference point.</li><br><li><b>X-pos. object meas. 2 (px)</b> (default = "") If "Reference mode 2" is set to "Object measurement", this is the measurement, associated with the current object, that will be used as the X-axis location of the second reference point.</li><br><li><b>Y-pos. object meas. 2 (px)</b> (default = "") If "Reference mode 2" is set to "Object measurement", this is the measurement, associated with the current object, that will be used as the Y-axis location of the second reference point.</li><br><li><b>Z-pos. object meas. 2 (slice)</b> (default = "") If "Reference mode 2" is set to "Object measurement", this is the measurement, associated with the current object, that will be used as the Z-axis location of the second reference point.</li><br><li><b>Measurement prefix</b> (default = "") The output measurement names will be prefixed with this value (although it can be left blank).  Using a prefix for these measurements allows multiple different widths to be output by multiple copies of this module.</li><br></ul>
