<h1>Bin objects by measurement</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
Distribute objects into a set of "bins" based on a measurement associated with each object.  Bins are evenly distributed between manually-specified smallest and largest bin centres.  The assigned bin for each object is stored as a new measurement associated with that object.
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<ul><li><b>Input objects</b> (default = "") Objects from the workspace.  The specified measurement for each of these will be binned according to various parameters.  The assigned bin will be stored as a new measurement associated with this object.</li><br><li><b>Measurement</b> (default = "") Measurement associated with the input objects that will be binned according to the other parameters.</li><br><li><b>Smallest bin centre</b> (default = "0.0") Centre value associated with the smallest bin.  Bins will be evenly distributed in bins between this value and the upper bin centre (specified by "Largest bin centre".</li><br><li><b>Largest bin centre</b> (default = "1.0") Centre value associated with the largest bin.  Bins will be evenly distributed in bins between this value and the lower bin centre (specified by "Smallest bin centre".</li><br><li><b>Number of bins</b> (default = "1") Number of bins to divide measurements into.  These will be evenly distributed in the range between "Smallest bin centre" and "Largest bin centre".</li><br></ul>
