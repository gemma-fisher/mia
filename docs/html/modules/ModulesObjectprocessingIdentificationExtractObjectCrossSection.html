<h1>Extract object cross section</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<ul><li><b>Input objects</b> (default = "") Input objects from workspace for which cross-sections will be extracted.  Output cross-section objects will be stored as children associated with the relevant input object.</li><br><li><b>Output objects</b> (default = "") Output cross-section objects.  These will be stored in the workspace with this name.  These objects will be children of their respective input object.</li><br><li><b>Reference mode</b> (default = "Absolute") The source for the reference Z-position for each object:<br><ul><li>"Absolute" The slice indices specified by "Relative slice indices" correspond to the absolute slice index of the coordinates.  For example, an index of 0 will extract the first slice and indices of "3-5" will load the 4th, 5th and 6th slices (note the use of zero-based indexing).</li><li>"Image measurement" The reference slice index will be taken from a measurement (specified by "Image measurement") associated with an image from the workspace (specified by "Image for measurement").  The slices indices specified by "Relative slice indices" will be relative to this measurement value.  For example, with an image measurement of 4 and specified index of "-2", the 3rd slice will be extracted (i.e. 2 below 4 using zero-based indexing).</li><li>"Object measurement" The reference slice index will be taken from a measurement (specified by "Object measurement") associated with the object being processed.  The slices indices specified by "Relative slice indices" will be relative to this measurement value.  For example, for an object with measurement value of 2 and specified index of "3", the 6th slice will be extracted (i.e. 3 above 2 using zero-based indexing).</li></ul></li><br><li><b>Image for measurement</b> (default = "") If "Reference mode" is set to "Image measurement", this is the image from which the reference measurement (specified by "Image measurement") will be taken.</li><br><li><b>Image measurement</b> (default = "") If "Reference mode" is set to "Image measurement", this is the measurement (associated with the image specified by "Image for measurement") which will act as the reference slice index against which the relative slice indices are calculated.</li><br><li><b>Object measurement</b> (default = "") If "Reference mode" is set to "Object measurement", this is the measurement (associated with the relevant input object) which will act as the reference slice index against which the relative slice indices are calculated.</li><br><li><b>Relative slice indices</b> (default = "0") Slices from the input objects will be extracted at these relative indices (relative to the position specified the "Reference mode" and associated parameters).  Indices can be specified as a comma-separated list, using a range (e.g. "4-7" will extract relative indices 4,5,6 and 7) or as a range extracting every nth slice (e.g. "4-10-2" will extract slices 4,6,8 and 10).  The "end" keyword will be converted to the maximum slice index at runtime.</li><br></ul>
