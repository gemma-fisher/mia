About MIA
------------
MIA is a Fiji plugin which provides a modular framework for assembling image and object analysis pipelines.  Detected objects can be transformed, filtered, measured and related.  Analysis pipelines are batch-enabled by default, allowing easy processing of high-content datasets.

MIA is developed in the [Wolfson Bioimaging Facility](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/wolfson-bioimaging/) at the University of Bristol.

Installation
------------
- The latest version of the plugin can be downloaded from the [Releases](https://github.com/SJCross/ModularImageAnalysis/releases) page.
- Place this .jar file into the /plugins directory of the your Fiji installation.
- MIA requires the "Biomedgroup" and "MorphoLibJ" plugins to be installed.
> - For MIA versions before 0.11.0: Launch Fiji's [Updater](https://imagej.net/Updater) tool and add the "Biomedgroup" and "IJPB-plugins" (possibly listed as "MorphoLibJ") update sites, then restart Fiji.
> - For MIA versions 0.11.0 or newer: Start MIA as usual, then click "Yes" when prompted to automatically download the updates.

Create new workflow
------------
- In Fiji, run the plugin from Plugins > Bristol WBIF > Modular Image Analysis
> - Select View > "Switch to editing view" from the menu bar
> - Modules are added and removed from the workflow using the "+" and "-" buttons
> - Module order can be shifted with the arrow buttons
> - Selecting a module will display its relevant parameters in the right panel
> - Checkboxes to the right of each module determine if they are visible in the basic view (default view)
> - Input files and folders are specified using the "Input control" and Excel file export is configured in the "Output control"

Use existing workflow
------------
- In Fiji, run the plugin from Plugins > Bristol WBIF > Modular Image Analysis
- To run an existing analysis workflow
> - Click "Load" and select the .mia workflow file
> - Depending on workflow configuration, a number of controls may be visible
> - When ready, click "Run" to start the analysis
> - While processing the status panel will display the number of files completed (batch mode) or a summary of the ongoing task (single file mode)
> - When finished, "Complete" will be displayed in the status panel.  Output XLS files will be saved in the input directory.
