Introduction
	- Background
		o Images and objects
		o Assigned measurements
		o Relationships between objects
		o Batch processing
	- Mention facility/University
	- Dependencies

Getting started
	- [Installation information already available]

Using an existing workflow
	- Loading the plugin
 	- Loading the workflow file
	- Changing options
	- Running the workflow
	- Finding results

Creating your first workflow
  	- Switching to “editor view”
	- Setting input controls
	- Adding modules
	- Setting outputs

Modules
	- Specific information about each Module
	- [Generate these files during compilation]
	- Include information about what the Module does, any key libraries used, what the inputs and outputs are and what measurements or relationships you get
	- Each Parameter could also have an associated description – this would need to be added in to the code

Macros
  	- Starting the macro functionality
	- Information about each macro operation (source documentation could also be included provided by the code)

Extending MIA
	- Host JavaDocs for MIA
	- Add MIA dependency
		o Mention Jitpack
	- Modules and Macros will automatically be imported if they are in the plugins directory
	- Writing Modules
		o Extend Module abstract class
