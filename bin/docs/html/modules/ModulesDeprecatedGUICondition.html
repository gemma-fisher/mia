<h1>GUI condition</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
DEPRECATED: Please use "Global variables" module (in "Choice" mode) in conjunction with "Fixed text condition", which offer equivalent functionality.<br><br>Implement variable workflow handling outcomes based on a user-selectable drop-down list of choices.  Each choice has a unique workflow outcome, which can include termination of the analysis and redirection of the active module to another part of the workflow.  Redirection allows parts of the analysis workflow to be skipped.<br><br>An example usage case for GUI conditions is providing a drop-down box on the basic control view.  With this simple control, the user can execute different blocks of the workflow without having to fundamentally understand how they are assembled.
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<ul><li><b>Continuation mode</b> (default = "Terminate") Controls what happens if the termination/redirection condition is met:<br><ul><li>"Redirect to module" The analysis workflow will skip to the module specified by the "Redirect module" parameter.  Any modules between the present module and the target module will not be evaluated.</li><li>"Terminate"The analysis will stop evaluating any further modules.</li></ul></li><br><li><b>Redirect module</b> (default = "") If the condition is met, the workflow will redirect to this module.  In doing so, it will skip evaluation of any modules between the present module and this module.</li><br><li><b>Show redirect message</b> (default = "false") Controls if a message should be displayed in the log if redirection occurs.</li><br><li><b>Redirect message</b> (default = "") Message to display if redirection occurs.</li><br><li><b>Export terminated workspaces</b> (default = "true") Controls if the workspace should still be exported to the output Excel spreadsheet if termination occurs.</li><br><li><b>Remove images from workspace</b> (default = "false") Controls if images should be completely removed from the workspace along with any associated measurements if termination occurs.</li><br><li><b>Remove objects from workspace</b> (default = "false") Controls if objects should be completely removed from the workspace along with any associated measurements if termination occurs.</li><br><li><b>Choice</b> (default = "") Currently-selected choice from the available set (all choices added via "Add choice" option).  The relevant workflow operation (e.g. termination/redirection) will be implemented for the selected condition.  This control can be made visible in the basic view, so users can select between a set of pre-determined outcomes.</li><br><li><b>Store as metadata item</b> (default = "false") When selected, the selected choice will be stored as a metadata item.  This allows it to be exported to the final spreadsheet.</li><br><li><b>Metadata name</b> (default = "") Name for selected choice to be stored as metadata using.  The choice will be accessible via this metadata name in subsequent modules and can be exported to the final spreadsheet.</li><br><li><b>Add choice</b> (default = "") Add another condition that "Choice" can select from.  Each choice can have its own handling outcome (e.g. termination/redirection).</li><br><li><b>Choice name</b> (default = "") Name that this choice will appear as in the "Choice" drop-down menu.</li><br><li><b>Continuation mode</b> (default = "Terminate") Controls what happens if the termination/redirection condition is met:<br><ul><li>"Redirect to module" The analysis workflow will skip to the module specified by the "Redirect module" parameter.  Any modules between the present module and the target module will not be evaluated.</li><li>"Terminate"The analysis will stop evaluating any further modules.</li></ul></li><br><li><b>Redirect module</b> (default = "") If the condition is met, the workflow will redirect to this module.
