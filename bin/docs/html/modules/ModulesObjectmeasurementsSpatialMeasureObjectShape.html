<h1>Measure object shape</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
Measures various spatial metrics for each object in a specified object collection from the workspace.  Measurements are associated with the relevant input object.  When dealing with 3D objects (those with coordinates spanning multiple Z-slices) a 2D projection into the XY plane will be used.
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<ul><li><b>Input objects</b> (default = "") Input objects from workspace.  Shape metrics will be calculated for each object and stored as measurements associated with that object.</li><br><li><b>Measure volume</b> (default = "true") When selected, 3D volume metrics will be calculated for each input object.  Metrics are: volume (px³), volume (calibrated_units³), number of voxels, base area (px²), base area (calibrated_units²), height (n_slices) and height (calibrated_units).</li><br><li><b>Measure projected area</b> (default = "false") When selected, 2D area metrics will be calculated for each input object.  For 3D objects, a 2D projection in the XY plane is used for measurements.  This projection includes all XY coordinates present in any Z-slice.  Metrics are: area (px²) and area (calibrated_units²).</li><br><li><b>Measure projected diameter</b> (default = "false") When selected, the diameter of 2D objects will be calculated for each input object.  For 3D objects, a 2D projection in the XY plane is used for measurements.  This projection includes all XY coordinates present in any Z-slice.  Metrics are: diameter (px) and diameter (calibrated_units).</li><br><li><b>Measure projected perimeter</b> (default = "false") When selected, the perimeter and circularity of 2D objects will be calculated for each input object.  For 3D objects, a 2D projection in the XY plane is used for measurements.  This projection includes all XY coordinates present in any Z-slice.  Metrics are: perimeter (px), perimeter (calibrated_units) and circularity.</li><br><li><b>Enable multithreading</b> (default = "true") Process multiple input objects simultaneously.  This can provide a speed improvement when working on a computer with a multi-core CPU.</li><br></ul>
