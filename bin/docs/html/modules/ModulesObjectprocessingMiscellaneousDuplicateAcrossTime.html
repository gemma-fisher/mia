<h1>Duplicate objects across time</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
Creates a copy of objects across all frames in the specified image stack.  Duplicated objects can either have their own set of coordinates or all share the set from the input object.  While sharing coordinates across all timepoints can be much more memory efficient (no redundant duplication of data is required), any change to the coordinates in one frame will result in the change being mirrored across all timepoints, so this mode should be used with care.
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<ul><li><b>Input objects</b> (default = "") Input objects to duplicate across multiple timepoints.</li><br><li><b>Output objects</b> (default = "") Output duplicated objects which will be added to the workspace.</li><br><li><b>Coordinates storage mode</b> (default = "Common") Controls whether the duplicated objects share the same common coordinate set or each have their own.  A duplicated coordinate set will use a lot less memory (as no redundant duplication of data is required), but should be used with caution, as any change to the coordinates in one frame will result in the change being mirrored across all timepoints.</li><br><li><b>Start frame mode</b> (default = "Fixed value") Specifies the source for the first timepoint the objects will be created for:<br><ul><li>"Fixed value" The first timepoint will be controlled by the value specified in the "Start frame fixed value" parameter.</li><li>"Image measurement" The first timepoint will be taken from a measurement ("Start frame image measurement" parameter) assigned to the image specified by "Start frame image".</li></ul></li><br><li><b>Start frame fixed value</b> (default = "0") If "Start frame mode" is set to "Fixed value", this is the fixed value that will be used as the first timepoint for the output duplicated objects.</li><br><li><b>Start frame image</b> (default = "") If "Start frame mode" is set to "Image measurement", this is the image from which the measurerment "Start frame image measurement" will be taken.</li><br><li><b>Start frame image measurement</b> (default = "") If "Start frame mode" is set to "Image measurement", this is the measurement that will be used as the first timepoint for the duplicated objects.</li><br><li><b>Start frame offset</b> (default = "0") If "Start frame mode" is set to "Image measurement", the first frame can be offset relative to the specified measurement by this number of frames.  For example, if the provided measurement is 5 and an offset of -1 is used, the first frame in the duplicated set will be 4.</li><br><li><b>End frame mode</b> (default = "Fixed value") Specifies the source for the last timepoint the objects will be created for:<br><ul><li>"Fixed value" The last timepoint will be controlled by the value specified in the "End frame fixed value" parameter.</li><li>"Image measurement" The last timepoint will be taken from a measurement ("End frame image measurement" parameter) assigned to the image specified by "End frame image".</li></ul></li><br><li><b>End frame fixed value</b> (default = "0") If "End frame mode" is set to "Fixed value", this is the fixed value that will be used as the last timepoint for the output duplicated objects.</li><br><li><b>End frame image</b> (default = "") If "End frame mode" is set to "Image measurement", this is the image from which the measurerment "End frame image measurement" will be taken.</li><br><li><b>End frame image measurement</b> (default = "") If "End frame mode" is set to "Image measurement", this is the measurement that will be used as the last timepoint for the duplicated objects.</li><br><li><b>End frame offset</b> (default = "0") If "End frame mode" is set to "Image measurement", the end frame can be offset relative to the specified measurement by this number of frames.  For example, if the provided measurement is 5 and an offset of -1 is used, the last frame in the duplicated set will be 4.</li><br></ul>
