<h1>Set spatial calibration</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
Update spatial calibration for XY and Z axes based on defined physical and corresponding image (pixel) distances.  Both physical and image distances can be drawn from a variety of sources including image and object measurements, fixed values and user-defined values (specified at runtime).  Calibration can be applied to XY and Z axes simultaneously or independently.
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<ul><li><b>Input image</b> (default = "") Image to which spatial calibration specified in this module will be applied.</li><br><li><b>Axis mode</b> (default = "XY") Controls to which image axes the spatial calibration specified in this module will applied:<br><ul><li>"XY" Calibration will be applied to X and Y axes only.  Z axis will retain its existing calibration.</li><li>"XY and Z" Calibration will be applied equally to XY and Z axes.</li><li>"Z" Calibration will be applied to Z axis only.  X and Y axes will retain their existing calibrations.</li></ul></li><br><li><b>Physical distance (PD) source</b> (default = "Fixed value") Source for physical distance measurement:<br><ul><li>"First object measurement" Distance is taken as the measurement (specified by "Objects measurement (PD)") for the first object in the collection "Objects for measurement (PD)".
