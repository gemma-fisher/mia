<h1>Create orthogonal view</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
Create a montage image showing orthogonal views of a specified input image from the workspace.  Orthogonal views are taken in the XY, XZ and YZ planes and all share a common coordinate.  This common coordinate can be the centre of the image or the centre of the largest object in a specified object collection.  The output orthogonal view is stored in the workspace as a separate image.
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<ul><li><b>Input image</b> (default = "") Image from workspace for which orthogonal view will be generated.  This image will not be affected by the process.</li><br><li><b>Output image</b> (default = "") Output orthogonal image showing orthogonal views in XY, XZ and YZ planes.  The output image will be formed from three panels, showing the orthogonal views, with white pixels elsewhere.  This image will be stored in the workspace using this name.</li><br><li><b>Position mode</b> (default = "Image centre") Controls how the orthogonal views are generated:<br><ul><li>"Image centre" Orthogonal views are extracted as single slices from the input image.  The views share a common coordinate, coincident with the centre of the image.</li><li>"Centroid of largest object" Orthogonal views are extracted as single slices from the input image.  The views share a common coordinate, coincident with the centre of the largest object from the collection specified by "Input objects".</li></ul></li><br><li><b>Input objects</b> (default = "") If "Position mode" is set to "Centroid of largest object", the orthogonal views will be positioned coincident with the centroid of the largest object from this collection.</li><br></ul>
