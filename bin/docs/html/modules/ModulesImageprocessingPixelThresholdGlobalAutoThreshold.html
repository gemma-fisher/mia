<h1>Global auto-threshold</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
Binarise an image in the workspace such that the output only has pixel values of 0 and 255.  Uses the built-in ImageJ global <a href="https://imagej.net/Auto_Threshold">auto-thresholding algorithms</a>.<br><br>Note: Currently only works on 8-bit images.  Images with other bit depths will be automatically converted to 8-bit based on the "Fill target range (normalise)" scaling method from the "Image type converter" module.
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<ul><li><b>Input image</b> (default = "") Image to apply threshold to.</li><br><li><b>Output mode</b> (default = "Calculate and apply") Controls if the threshold is applied to the input image or only calculated and stored as a measurement:<br><ul><li>"Calculate and apply" Calculate the threshold and apply it to the input image.  Whether the binarised image updates the input image or is saved as a separate image to the workspace is controlled by the "Apply to input image" parameter.  In this mode the calculated threshold is still stored as a measurement of the input image.</li><li>"Calculate only" Calculate the threshold, but do not apply it to the input image.  The calculated threshold is only stored as a measurement of the input image.</li></li><br><li><b>Apply to input image</b> (default = "true") Select if the threshold should be applied directly to the input image, or if it should be applied to a duplicate, then stored as a different image in the workspace.</li><br><li><b>Output image</b> (default = "") Name of the output image created during the thresholding process.  This image will be added to the workspace.</li><br><li><b>Algorithm</b> (default = "Huang") Global thresholding algorithm to use.  Choices are: Huang, Intermodes, IsoData, Li, MaxEntropy, Mean, MinError, Minimum, Moments, Otsu, Percentile, RenyiEntropy, Shanbhag, Triangle, Yen.</li><br><li><b>Threshold multiplier</b> (default = "1.0") Prior to application of automatically-calculated thresholds the threshold value is multiplied by this value.  This allows the threshold to be systematically increased or decreased.  For example, a "Threshold multiplier" of 0.9 applied to an automatically-calculated threshold of 200 will see the image thresholded at the level 180.</li><br><li><b>Use lower threshold limit</b> (default = "false") Limit the lowest threshold that can be applied to the image.  This is used to prevent unintentional segmentation of an image containing only background (i.e. no features present).</li><br><li><b>Lower threshold limit</b> (default = "0.0") Lowest absolute threshold value that can be applied.</li><br><li><b>Binary logic</b> (default = "Black (0) background") Controls whether objects are considered to be white (255 intensity) on a black (0 intensity) background, or black on a white background.</li><br></ul>
