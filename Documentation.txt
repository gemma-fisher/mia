- Loading images into a workflow
    - General
        - Input control only specifies root path.  It doesn't actually load any data.
        - If a folder, MIA iterates over each valid file, running the analysis workflow on each file.
    - Current file
        - Simple, gives access to that selected file.
    - From ImageJ
        - Must be an open window
    - Specific file
        - Will be the same for all analysis runs (good for reference images)
